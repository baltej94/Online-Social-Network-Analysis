1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 238 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?

The friend overlap function computes the shared account followed by each pair of users.
* Jill Stein and Gary Johnson share 236 friends
* Gary Johnson and Hillary Clinton share 18 friends
* Gary Johnson and Donald Trump share 12 friends
* Jill Stein and Hillary Clinton share 5 friends
* Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump share 2 friends.

We cannot conclude that Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton 
and Donald Trump based on 'actual numbers' of the similar friends. 

This approach is misleading as the total number of user accounts followed between the 
candidates might be different. 

Gary Johnson follows 3511 accounts
Jill Stein follows 1643 accounts
Hillary Clinton follows 784 accounts
Donald Trump follows 45 accounts

One can fix this by using the percentage of shared friends to total number of friends 
as compared to only using the number of shared friends.

Similarity between Jill Sten and Gary Johnson : (236 / (3511 + 1643)) * 100 = 4.6 % 
Similarity between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: (2 / (784 + 45)) * 100 = 0.24 %

After looking at the percentage we can conclude that Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are 
more similar as compared to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump based on the criteria 
of shared friends.





2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.

Two user accounts are being followed by both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: 
VP (Vice President Mike Pence) and WhiteHouse (The White House).

As both Hillary Clinton (a former First lady and an aspiring US President) and 
Donald Trump (the current US President), it would make sense for them to follow 
WhiteHouse as it is a common interest.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are rivals. Mike Pence is the current US Vice President. 
Donald Trump follows the vice President. 

In my opinion, Hillary Clinton also follows the vice President in order to keep tabs on 
the US President, as she does not directly follow Donald Trump the next best thing would 
be the twitter account of the vice President Mike Pence. 





3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?

Donald Trump follows 45 accounts while on the other hand Gary Johnson follows 3511 accounts

Based cursory glance of the accounts followed by both the candidates, the most of the accounts followed
by Donald Trump belong to his family members and the Trump brands (such as Trump Hotel, Trump Washington DC, 
Trump LA and so on).

Whereas Gary Johnson follows a lot of people and small organizations from diverse backgrounds. 
I guess he likes to interact with lot of people and different organizations.

Analysis might be biased as Gary Johnson follows more accounts as compared to Donald Trump.
The followed accounts twitter feed are also different, that is, Accounts beloning to individuals are different
as compared to Accounts belong to organizations.





4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

Twitter rate limit: 15 calls every 15 minutes window.

To complete the follower graph we have to collect the list of accounts followed by each of the friends.

The current graph has data from the four candidates.  [4 API Calls]
Each candidate has the following number of friends:
* Gary Johnson follow 3511 Accounts                   [3511 API Calls]
* Jill Stein follows 1643 accounts                    [1643 API Calls]
* Hillary Clinton follows 784 accounts                [784 API Calls]
* Donald Trump follows 45 accounts                    [45 API Calls]

Total Calls to complete the whole graph from scratch: 3511+1642+784+45+4 = 5986

Removing common accounts [Redudant API calls]: (3511+1643+784+45+4-236-18-12-5-2) = 5714

Therefore:  5714/15 = 380.93333 windows.

Total time taken to complete the graph: (380 * 15) + (1 to 14)  =  5701 to 5714 minutes.
