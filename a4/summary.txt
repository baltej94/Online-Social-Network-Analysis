Example of Positive Instance: 
 @realDonaldTrump At least we have a few excellent journalists left in the US - especially at NYTimes. Canâ€™t wait until we the people see the Full Muller Report!

Example of Negative Instance: 
 @Greg_Sbutta @krassenstein The attorney general is acting as Trump's personal attorney and was appointed by Trump for Trump. Since we are talking about conflict of interests. Besides did you read the Muller report. My guess is you didn't because it's damning.

Example of Neutral Instance:
