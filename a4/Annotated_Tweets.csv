BigBobSmoker1,@LindseyGrahamSC @GOP His campaign literally told the Russians it was OK to spy on American citizens.  They didn’t report anything to the secret service or FBI. They are traders of the highest level. This is true this is what they admitted to in the Muller report.,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120854862231744514,-1
Juanita29366652,Righteous Truth:According to the all news media the Muller report is a best seller. People are reading the report not some bull shit summary that fat ass barr wrote.Guess what the trumpsupporters aren't reading Muller's report because those motherfuckers can't read!,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120854832276025344,-1
LeperaRobert,"@QC_Bounce @gatxer01 @rickrosa10 @brithume Muller report lays it out. President Bone Spurs is soooo passive around Putin why is that?

Lou2uLou,@SpeakerPelosi @windmillcharger You are being dishonest moving the goal posts. Two years ago you told us to wait for the Muller report. We delivered a majority to you on your pledge to hold Trump accountable. The Muller report was released showing enough obstruction of justice to start impeachment hearings.,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120854216476626947,-1
HailNuke,@ApprovalVote @MYGREYGARDENS Yep its clear you did not read the report.Theirs a part in the report that showed trump trying to fire Robert Muller but the people around him did not carry out his order,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120853348633260032,0

hankt1972,@paulkrugman So Hillary bought the steel dossier and turn out to Russian screwing everyone. Sounds like Obama and his administration drop the ball. Because I read the Muller report which really seems like a Democrat playbook but I guess this is the insurance policy they were texting about.,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120853257646149632,-1
RockinW5,@DNCWarRoom @realDonaldTrump Why should he what do you hope to accomplish you won’t even tell the truth about the Muller report.,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120853044852330496,0
sidapps,@JerryMoran did u think that the Muller report clears Trump &amp; no aids should honor oversight subpoenas?,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120852955811463169,-1
peek_r,@RepAdamSchiff Once again you pathetic liberals are trying to spin your bull 💩 stories to fit you harassment. FB testified that LESS then 4000 negative posts were used. Twitter is as equally. The Muller report clearly states that NO Trump people were involved in or participated with Russia!,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120852859476639744,-1

TMPeace2,@legaleagle48 @modernangelo @PeteButtigieg I have watched most videos and they are compelling.  However I understand what is being said about the lack of policy specifics.  Pete never answers how he will implement his policies and what is the timeline.  The muller report is #1 for a reason it has details,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120852005927432192,1
AdelysArt,@realDonaldTrump The way you chased Obama’s birth certificate was a witch hunt. The judicial process that went through to produce Muller’s report was legal because no one is above the law and suspicion of election fraud should always be investigated. You are NOT a victim,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120851337841762304,-1
gordonr2k13,@realDonaldTrump Go fuck your mother. You are guilty as hell. EVERYONE knows you obstructed Justice and very soon you will piss off the wrong person who has proof of your treason. Bars summary of the Muller report is a joke and Congress is going to get the full report. YOU'RE OUR BITCH NOW BOY!,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120850936904278016,-1
pastorkengeer,@SpeakerPelosi The muller report did not have enough to indict the president. Go ahead and waste your time on more worthless media stunts and the american people will get nothing from the House.,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120849824218263552,-1

James81030796,@joncoopertweets You absolute dumbass. The Muller report stated they didn’t make a choice on obstruction so they left it to the attorney general and his team to see the evidence where they then concluded their was no obstruction.,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120849303147249671,-1
Lou2uLou,@SpeakerPelosi @windmillcharger You said two years ago when we called for impeachment to wait for the Muller report. Now we have it and you say we need to wait for the unredacted version. You are moving the goal posts to deceive those who supported you and gave you the majority. You're being dishonest.,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120849261216829440,-1
gbdinterests,@realDonaldTrump At least we have a few excellent journalists left in the US - especially at NYTimes. Can’t wait until we the people see the Full Muller Report!,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120849227175878657,1
Claritybear,@jenimanon @GeorgeTakei You’re right @jenimanon there are lots of folks who live pay check to pay check who care. And many who don’t-for many of reasons. And the later group is why we have our current president. The results of the Muller Report is not going to the minds of most of them.,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120849125770182662,0

thesetearsicry,This is how you know color people are not treated equal when it comes to the ruling in this society. Because if the Muller report was a reflection of Barack Obama doing there would have been no question about impeachment just the words. IMPEACH HIM NOW. Why not say that now?,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120848695279247360,-1

VittoriaRose2,@Greg_Sbutta @krassenstein The attorney general is acting as Trump's personal attorney and was appointed by Trump for Trump. Since we are talking about conflict of interests. Besides did you read the Muller report. My guess is you didn't because it's damning.,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120848357570772992,-1
Triplenichol,@neal_katyal What took him so long?  It's not like the Muller report was some kind of revelation.  We knew about russians porn stars endless lies.  Real courage would have been to stand up 2 years ago...better late than never?,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1120847896264372224,0
